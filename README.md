## Credit Limit Optimizer

This project involves developing a machine learning model to predict credit limits for customers using historical data. The pipeline includes data preprocessing, model training, and deployment via a Flask web application. The process begins with loading and preparing data, followed by training a RandomForestRegressor model. The trained model and preprocessing steps are saved as pickle files. The Flask app serves as an API endpoint, allowing users to input customer data and receive predicted credit limits in real-time.
